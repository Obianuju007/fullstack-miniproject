# Fullstack Miniproject
This is a collection of miniprojects I'm working on in order to build my skill as a Developer.
The links will be shown via buttons. So in case you see buttons, just know it could be a link to a small project. Cheers 

So I joined Zuri and I4G training cohort 1 for 2022 and below were links to the several tasks I was made to work on.
