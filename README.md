# Fullstack Miniproject
This is a collection of miniprojects I'm working on in order to build my skill as a Developer.

> ## My Personal Project is this invite app as you will see.
It's basically an app where one can invite people for events privately. The goal is to produce a QR code which can only be shared after creating an event. When your viewers get the code they can scan it for details of the event. The qr code will contain the name, address, host and time of the event.
